  intro: "<p>Hi, my name is Alex Chaplinsky and I'm a traveller, content creator and youtuber. There's a common trend on social media amongst content creators to show the very best side of their lives, glamorous and easy going lifestyle.</p> <p>This makes viewers compare them with something that they are watching and feel that their lives are not as exciting or they are not pretty enough, not successful enough and eventually feel depressed because of that.</p><p>But besides those pretty images there's also reall life. Where you have to work hard and you can have good days as well as bad days. And that's what content creators should tell us about.</p>"
  about_channel: "<p>My YouTube channel is a place where I can creatively share my thoughts and that's why is in not single-topic channel.<br />But if I had to define main categories of content that I'm creating I would boil it down to these 3 topics:</p>"
  contact_text: "<p><strong>Please read this before contacting me:</strong></p><p>As this community grows bigger I get a lot of messages into my DM on social media and unfortunatelly I don't have time to respond to every message.</p><p>I'm trying to stay dedicated to creating meaningful videos and tutorials every week which takes a huge commitment of time and energy. There's also personal life and work, which is even a bigger part of my life than what I do on YouTube. So if you really need to contact me it is better to use email: <a href=\"mailto:hello@alchaplinsky.com\">hello@alchaplinsky.com</a>.</p><p>Messages I usually get are from viewers asking for advice about the specific challenges they're dealing with. While I don't have the bandwidth to respond to each email, you can still send your questions so that I might address them in future videos.</p><p>For interviews, press and other inquiries please use the button below.</p>"
  about_text: "<h3>Hi, my name is Alex Chaplinsky and Iâ€™m a traveller, filmmaker and youtuber.</h3><p>I was born and spent most of my life in Kiev (Ukraine). I was 25 years old when I went abroad for the first time. And my first country was Thailand. After this trip my life has changed completely.</p><p>Next 7 years I was constantly travelling and I've only spent a couple of month back home. During this time I'd been living in Thailand for about 2 years and now for around 3 years I am more or less permanently based in Krakow (Poland).</p><p>During these travels I became a real fan of videography because I wanted to share my experiences and impressions with others and of course save some special memories for myself. That's how I started my Travel Vlog where I try to show vibes of the cities I visit to the viewers.</p><p>Aside from that I also create a lot of tutorials on shooting videos and editing in russian. You can find a lot of free lessons on my YouTube channel as well as fully fledged <a href=\"https://onlinecourse.pro/adobe-premiere\" target=\"_blank\">online editing courses</a>.</p><p>And also a create a lot of videos about motivation, self development and world around us. YouTube is a great platform for creativity and communication with people on different actual, social and interesting topics. </p><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoI8hLJndOYsNwk0NUQN0OQ?sub_confirmation=1\" class=\"button\" target=\"_blank\">SUBSCRIBE TO MY CHANNEL</a>"
