  intro: "<p>Привет, меня зовут Алекс Чаплинский and I'm a traveller, content creator and youtuber. There's a common trend on social media amongst content creators to show the very best side of their lives, glamorous and easy going lifestyle.</p><p>This makes viewers compare them with something that they are watching and feel that their lives are not as exciting or they are not pretty enough, not successful enough and eventually feel depressed because of that.</p><p>But besides those pretty images there's also reall life. Where you have to work hard and you can have good days as well as bad days. And that's what content creators should tell us about.</p>"
  about_channel: "<p>My YouTube channel is a place where I can creatively share my thoughts and that's why is in not single-topic channel.<br />But if I had to define main categories of content that I'm creating I would boil it down to these 3 topics:</p>"
  contact_text: "<p>Please read this before contacting me:</p><p>As this community grows bigger I get a lot of messages into my DM on social media and unfortunatelly I don't have time to respond to every message.</p><p>I'm trying to stay dedicated to creating meaningful videos and tutorials every week which takes a huge commitment of time and energy. There's also personal life and work, which is even a bigger part of my life than what I do on YouTube. So if you really need to contact me it is better to use email:<a href=\"mailto:hello@alchaplinsky.pro\">hello@alchaplinsky.pro</a>.</p><p>Messages I usually get are from viewers asking for advice about the specific challenges they're dealing with. While I don't have the bandwidth to respond to each email, you can still send your questions so that I might address them in future videos.</p><p>For interviews, press & other inquiries please use the button below.</p>"
